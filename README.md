### The initial was to develop a game where I continually raycast and update the position of an object based on player position updation. Seemed doable but I could not get raycasting to update object positions as i am learning Unity right now. I spent the day trying to make it work and then gave up. 

## Day 2 (23-12-31)
### The game idea is now a simple 'Catch The Ball' game with a simple gameplay loop of catching balls with a player object that moves based on player tapping and dragging on screen. If you drop a ball you lose, and ball objects form and fall downwards around you. The main dificulty constraining factors are: 
### 1. Ball speed.
### 2. Ball Spawn Interval.
### 3. Ball Spawn distance from player position.
## Current bugs:
### Beginning to understand functionalities but struggled heavily today with implementing a simple mechanic, The dropping spheres are somehow facing a collision triggered way above the player object's plane and are being destroyed.
#3 Day 3 & 4 (24-1-2)
### Worked on the previous bugs and continuously iterated through Debugging to fix some of the ball movement issues. Current problems include spacing out the ball spawn areas and collision. Documentation recorded in Playtest folder.
