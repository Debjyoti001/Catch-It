### The initial was to develop a game where I continually raycast and update the position of an object based on player position updation. Seemed doable but I could not get raycasting to update object positions as i am learning Unity right now. I spent the day trying to make it work and then gave up. 

## Day 2 (23-12-31)
### The game idea is now a simple 'Catch The Ball' game with a simple gameplay loop of catching balls with a player object that moves based on player tapping and dragging on screen. If you drop a ball you lose, and ball objects form and fall downwards around you. The main dificulty constraining factors are: 
### 1. Ball speed.
### 2. Ball Spawn Interval.
### 3. Ball Spawn distance from player position.
